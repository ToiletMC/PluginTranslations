  actions: |-
    `<title text="Spell Actions">`
    `<p>`Actions are the building blocks of a spell's logic.
    `<p>`Without actions, a spell does nothing except create particle effects or sounds.
    `<p>`Action parameters can go in the "parameters" section of a spell's configuration, alongside `<help topic="spell_parameters" text="base spell parameters">`.
    `<p>`Action parameters in the "parameters" section can be overridden as normal by /cast commands or wand
    `<p>`overrides, but actions placed directly in the actions list can not.
    `<p>`In general it is good practice to put all parameters in the "parameters" section for easy reading, but there
    `<p>`are cases where it is necessary to put them in the actions list. Generally this would be because you have
    `<p>`two of the same actions in the logic that you want to use different parameters.
    `<p>`They can also go directly underneath the corresponding action in the "actions" list.

  attributes: |-
    `<title text="Attributes">`
    `<p>`&dMagic&f has a set of builtin attributes and a system for adding custom attributes.
    `<p>`These attributes can be used in any spell, wand, class or other config property.
    `<p>`Equations can be formed using one or more attributes (or variables) for complex spell behaviors.
    `<p>`Custom attributes can be modified for each player buy spells, wands or classes.
    `<p>`Magic will print a list of all available attributes, builtin and custom, on startup. Check your logs!
    `<li`>See the `<link url="https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/tree/master/Magic/src/main/resources/examples/rpg/attributes" text="RPG configs">` for examples of custom attributes as well as using them with an attribute selector.
    `<li>`Use `<command command="meditor attribute custom" text="the editor">` to create and edit custom attributes.
  aureliumskills: |-
    `<title text="Aurelium Skills">`
    `<p>`&dMagic integrates with `<link url="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/aurelium-skills-advanced-skills-stats-abilities-and-more.81069/" text="Aurelium Skills">`
    `<p>`Aurelium Skills stat and skill points can be used as variables in Magic configs.
    `<p>`Simply use the name of the skill or stat, make sure to uppercase it such as SORCERY.
    `<p>`Magic will not use Aurelium Skills mana by default, but you can `<command command="mconfig config aurelium_skills.use_mana true" text="turn it on">` if you want.
    `<p>`Note that you may have progression issues since Aurelium mana will not increase in lockstep with Magic path progression.
    `<p>`So, some additional customization may be required if using AS mana.

    `<title text="Classes">`
    `<p>`Classes in Magic are a way to associate a group of properties with a player.
    `<p>`A player can have multiple classes.
    `<p>`Wands can be assigned to classes, which means they can cast spells
    `<p>`that a player has learned, rather than the spells being attached to a wand item.
    `<p>`Classes can also add vanilla attributes, mana, protection, or other magic properties.

    `<title text="Customizing Spell Damage">`
    `<p>`Customizing spell damage can be tricky, most spells that deal damage &blevel up&f to deal more damage.
    `<p>`In addition, the &7Damage&f action supports separate damage for mobs versus players.
    `<p>``<command command="meditor spell missile" text="Use the editor to edit a spell">`
    `<p>`Then look in the &bparameters&f section for damage-related properties.
    `<p>`Scroll down to find the levelled up version of the spell, and change damage parameters there too.
    `<p>`Note that some spells, like &7Fireball&f, &7Boom&f, or &7Fire&f deal indirect damage and as such require special handling to change damage.
    `<p>`For explosions, the &7size&f parameter deals more damage, but take care as a bigger explosion also means more blocks broken.
    `<p>`You can also `<command command="mconfig material indestructible *" text="make all block types indestructible">` to prevent spells from damaging blocks.
  decorating: |-
    `<title text="Decorating with Magic Items">`
    `<p>`&6Wand&f items can not be put into containers by default.
    `<p>`This includes item frames!
    `<p>`If you want to decorate with a wand item, you must turn it into a regular item first.
    `<li>`Use the `<command command="wand destroy" text="wand destroy">` command to make a wand a normal item.
    `<li>`Use `<command command="wand restore" text="wand restore">` to get a bound wand back if you accidentally destroy it.
  default_configs: |-
    `<title text="Default Configs">`
    `<p>`&dMagic &f will output the effective configs it is using to the &7plugins/Magic/defaults&f folder.
    `<p>`This includes the default configs, any loaded examples (such as &bsurvival&f) and all of your customizations.
    `<p>`These files can be useful to see how things work or what you can edit.
    `<p>`However, please be aware they can not be edited directly. Magic will overwrite them every restart.
    `<p>`This is a confusing point for most people looking to customize this plugin.
    `<p>`Please see the `<help topic="general_customization" text="customization guide">` for more information!
  disguises: |-
    `<title text="Disgusies">`
    `<p>`&dMagic integrates with &b`<link url="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/libs-disguises-free.81/" text="LibsDisguises">`&f for mob and spell disguises.
    `<p>`Mobs can use disguises, and the Disguise action can be used to disguise mobs or players.
    `<p>`In both cases, a disguise parameter is used to configure the disguise.
    `<p>`Player disguises can be used, see the `<link url="https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/blob/master/Magic/src/main/resources/examples/survival/mobs/madscientist.yml" text="Mad Scientist">` mob for example.
    `<p>`A specific skin/profile can also be used, see `<link url="https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/blob/master/Magic/src/main/resources/examples/survival/mobs/ironman.yml" text="Iron Man">` mob for example.
    `<p>`You need a full profile, though, just a URL will not work. You can set a skin as your own and capture your profile using the `<command command="mage skin" text="mage skin">` command.
    `<p>`See `<link url="https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/wiki/Disguises" text="the wiki">` for more information.
  donator_shops: |-

    `<p>`&dMagic shops&f can handle the unlocking directly in-game, using a custom magic currency, or TokenManager integration.
    `<p>`Commands can also be used to perform unlocks directly if you'd prefer a web-based storefront to do the unlocking.
    `<p>`Once unlocked a player can use a &dMagic shop&f menu to select their vanity items at any time.

    `<p>`&dMagic &fcan be very confusing to configure at first.
    `<p>`People often go to edit &7plugins/Magic/config.yml&f or &7spells.yml&f and wonder where everything is.
    `<p>`Because &dMagic&f is so configuration-driven, it is very important that configs can be updated every time the plugin updates.
    `<p>`This would be difficult if everyone got a copy of &oall&f of the configs to edit every time they installed the plugin.

    `<p>`&dMagic &fuses a &bmana&f system in many of its configs, including survival, stars bending and even war (as ammo).
    `<p>`Mana is a shared resource pool across all spells in a class (e.g. survival mana is separate from bending energy)
    `<p>`Mana regenerates over time, up to a max value. &bWands&f show mana in custom mana bars, the XP display or other places as configured.
    `<p>`&bSpells&f each require a different amount of mana to cast.
    `<p>`Some special items, such as the &b`<command command="mgive talisman" text="Mana Talisman">`&f and &b`<command command="mgive wizardhelmet" text="Wizard armor">`&f can increase your mana stats.

    `<li>``<command command="wand configure mana_regeneration 100" text="Configure mana regeneration per second on a demo wand">`
    `<p>`Class-based wands (such as the &bsurvival&f and other builtin examples' wands) have their mana controlled by &bprogression&f and can not be directly changed.
    `<p>`Mana for these classes and wands is controlled by the &bpath&f config, players mana max and regeneration changes as they &brank up&f.
    `<p>`Use &b`<command command="meditor path beginner" text="the editor">` &fto change the &7override_properties&f section.

    `<p>`If you can not PvP in an area, you may not be able to cast some spells their either.
    `<p>`Any spells that require changing blocks can not be cast if you can't change blocks there by hand.

  right_click: |-
    `<title text="Right Clicks and Offhand Items">`
    `<p>`Wands use right-click for spell cycling by default, these `<help topic="wandcontrols" text="controls">` are customizable.
    `<p>`If you have certain items in your offhand, wands will ignore right-clicks.
    `<p>`This is to allow vanilla offhand item behavior without wands getting in the way.
    `<p>`You can `<command command="meditor materials offhand" text="edit the list of offhand items">` if you want to change this behavior.
    `<p>`Right-clicking an enchantment table with a wand will bring up the `<command command="cast progressmenu" text="progress menu">`
    `<p>`If the enchant table is not working but right-clicks are working otherwise, check your configs to make sure you don't have &7enchant_click&f set to an empty string.
  sandbox: |-
    `<title text="The Magic Sandbox Editor">`
    `<p>`&dMagic&f hosts a public &bsandbox&f server where you can try out making your own spells.
    `<p>`First, go to &bhttps://sandbox.elmakers.com&f in your web browser.
    `<p>`Then log in to &7sandbox.elmakers.com&f in Minecraft.
    `<p>`Using the same web editor as the &7/meditor&f command uses, you can make your own spells.
    `<p>`Saving a spell in the editor forces configs to reload on the server.
    `<p>`Your &6Sandbox Wand&f will contain all of the spells that you've made in the sandbox editor.
  shops: |-
    `<title text="Magic Shops">`
    `<p>`&dMagic &fshops use a shared economy configuration for item pricing. Prices can be customized in &bitems&f configuration, or in-game.
    `<li>``<command command="mgive diamond" text="Give yourself a diamond">`

    `<li>``<help topic="playershops" text="About player shops">`
  skript: |-
    `<title text="Skript">`
    `<p>`The `<link url="https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases" text="Skript">` plugin can be used with &dMagic&f.
    `<p>`There are several Magic-related events and expressions you can use.
    `<li>`See more information `<link url="https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/wiki/Skript" text="on the wiki">`
  spell_levels: |-
    `<title text="Spell Levels">`
    `<p>`Some spells, particularly most of the &6survival&f example spells, can level up.
    `<p>`Spells level up automatically by use. Some levels are gated by &bpath progression&f.
    `<p>`Players can check on their spell progress using the `<command command="cast upgrades" text="Upgrades section">` of the enchant table menu.
    `<p>`In configs, spell levels are separate spells using a &6spell&f|&blevel&f naming convention.
    `<p>`To add new levels, simply add another spell following that name format.
    `<li>``<command command="mage levelspells" text="Max out all your spells">`
    `<li>``<command command="wand configure level_spells true" text="Configure a wand to max out its spells">`
    `<li>``<command command="mage add missile|5" text="Give yourself a specific level of a specific spell">`
    `<li>``<command command="meditor spell missile" text="Edit the Magic Missile spell and all of its levels">`
  spell_parameters: |-
    `<title text="Spell Parameters">`
    `<p>`Spell parameters go in the &7parameters&f section of a spell.
    `<p>`These parameters can be overridden by &7/cast&f parameters or &bwand overrides&f:
    `<li>``<command command="cast missile block_hit_count 20" text="Cast a more powerful Magic Missile">`
    `<li>``<command command="cast blob undo 1000" text="Cast a very short-lived Blob">`
    `<p>`They can also be modified by a wand with overrides on it, such as:
    `<li>``<command command="wand override missile.damage_multiplier 20" text="Make your wand cast a super-deadly Magic Missile">`
    `<p>`Wand overrides can also be made to apply to all spells cast by that wand:
    `<li>``<command command="wand override undo 0" text="Make all spells cast by your wand do permanent block damagee">`
    `<p>`This can simplify spell testing, or allow you to make wands that cast spells in different ways.
    `<p>``<help topic="actions" text="Spell actions">` read their parameters from the main parameters section, unless they are defined alongside the action.
    `<p>`Spells also have several common base parameters that are not used by actions, such as &7target&f and &7cooldown&f.
    `<li>``<link url="https://reference.elmakers.com/#spellParameters" text="See common spell parameters in the reference guide">`
  spell_points: |-
    `<title text="SP: Spell Points">`
    `<p>`&6Spell points&f &7(&bSP&7)&f are earned whenever a player &osuccessfully&f casts a spell. For most spells, &bsuccess&f is determined by hitting a valid mob or player target.
    `<p>`&6Spell points&f have a &ecooldown &ffor earning. This cooldown is specific to each spell, and defaults to &e15 minutes&f.
    `<p>`This means that once you have more than one spell, using each one frequently is the fastest way to earn SP!
    `<p>`The &6Magic Missile&f spell is a special case, it allows for faster SP earning at the start to get palyers going.
    `<p>`Once players have more than one spell they can earn SP much faster by using all of their spells frequently.
    `<li>``<command command="mgive @p sp 1000" text="Give yourself some SP">`
    `<li>``<command command="mconfig spell default earns_cooldown 30 seconds" text="Reduce SP cooldown to 30 seconds">`
    `<li>``<link url="https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/wiki/SpellPoints#balancing-sp" text="See the wiki for more info">
  spell_properties: |-
    `<title text="Spell Properties">`
    `<p>`Spells have some top-level properties, such as their icon or casting costs.
    `<p>`These properties can not be overridden by &7/cast&f parameters or &bwand overrides&f.
    `<li>``<link url="https://reference.elmakers.com/#spellProperties" text="See spell properties in the reference guide">`
  support: |-
    `<title text="Support">`
    `<li>``<link text="Join the Magic Discord for live help and support" url="https://discord.elmakers.com">`

    `<li>``<link text="More support links on wiki" url="https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/wiki/Support">`
  trails: |-
    `<title text="Trails">`
    `<p>`Players can purchase (using Spell Points) trails that will show while they are holding their wand.
    `<p>`These include builtin trails like the crown, demon tail and butterfly wings.
    `<p>`This is done in the `<command command="cast effectshop" text="Effect Shop">`
    `<p>`Which is accessible in the `<command command="cast progressmenu" text="enchantment table menu">`
    `<p>`There is also an optional `<command command="cast trailshop" text="Trail Shop">` you can allow via an NPC or other means.
    `<p>`Note that the trail shop must be used to remove its trails, they are separate from the wand and will always show on the player.
    `<p>`Non-wand trails are implemented as `<help topic="classes" text="magic classes">`
    `<p>`And so you can use the `<command command="mage deactivate crown" text="mage deactivate">`command to turnt hem off.
  updating: |-
    `<title text="Updating the Plugin">`
    `<p>`Updating &dMagic &f should generally be as simple as replacing the plugin jar
    `<p>`Backwards-compatibility of your custom configs is always a top priority!
    `<p>`However, some major updates have changed things around. Always check the `<link url="https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/blob/master/Magic/MIGRATION.md" text="migration log">` on major updates.
    `<p>`Updating to Magic 10 had a few specific gotchas:
    `<p>`Changed the meaning of the `locked` tag on wands, to match the behavior of items, classes and recipes
    `<p>`Use "modifiable: false" for the same behavior as "locked: true" used to have
    `<p>`If this is a big issue to update, use `<command command="mconfig config old_wand_locked_behavior true" text="this command">` to revert to the old behavior.
  wandcontrols: |-
    `<title text="Wand Controls">`
    `<p>`Wand controls are completely customizable.
    `<p>`Players can use the `<command command="cast controlsmenu" text="controls menu">` to change their controls.
    `<p>`Players can also change their `<help topic="wandgui" text="GUI">` (second hotbar and mana bar) in that same menu.
    `<p>`You may also change the default controls
    `<p>`The simplest way is to `<command command="meditor config wand_slots" text="edit the wand_slots config">`, changing the &7default_slotted&f property.
    `<p>`Available builtin control schemes: &7controls_cycle&f, &7controls_hotbarswap&f, &7controls_inventory
  wandgui: |-
    `<title text="Wand GUI">`
    `<p>`The &6wand&f second hotbar and mana &bGUI&f uses custom font glyphs from the resource pack
    `<p>`This means that the resource pack is &brequired&f, and this only works on &6Minecraft 1.16&f and above.
    `<p>`You will need to be using the official &aMagic&f resource pack, or you can `<link url="https://merge.elmakers.com" text="merge your own RP with the Magic RP">`
    `<p>`If you see squares instead of the hotbar glyphs, you have the &bwrong resource pack&f.
    `<li>``<command command="mconfig config wand_slots.gui.default_slotted gui_bossbar" text="Change wand default to use the boss bar GUI instead of the action bar">`
    `<li>``<command command="mconfig config wand_slots.gui.default_slotted gui_none" text="Turn off the wand GUI hotbar by default">`
  wands: |-
    `<title text="Wands">`
    `<p>`Wands in &dMagic&f are special items that can be used for casting spells, and may also grant the holder special effects or buffs.
    `<p>`Wands don't necessarily need to look or act like wands, they can take the form of armor, bows, swords or any other item.
    `<p>`The &7wand configure&f command can be used in-game to quickly change and test wand properties.
    `<li>``<command command="wand configure icon diamond" text="Change your wand to look like a diamond">`
    `<li>``<command command="meditor spell mynewwand" text="Create a new wand using the editor">`
    `<li>``<command command="mgive basic_wand" text="Give yourself a basic wand">`
    `<li>``<command command="wand configure cost_reduction 2" text="Make a wand cost-free">` so it will not require or use mana
